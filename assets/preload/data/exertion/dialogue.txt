:GF:r:Normal Troubled:You DO know he could legitimately kill you, right?

:GF:r:Normal Dismissive:Uh, yeah I do...
:GF:r:Normal Annoyed:You're not as strong as you think you are, Cuz. 
:GF:r:Normal Annoyed:You're wasting your time trying to fight my family over and over again.

:Cuz:l:Angry:Shut the hell up and do your little... transformation thing already.
:GF:r:Normal Troubled:Cuz, I'm not gonna-
:Cuz:l:Ticked Off:I'm not giving you a choice.
:GF:r:Normal Troubled:...
:GF:r:Normal Annoyed:...Alright, fine...
:GF:r:Unsure Demon:But we're doing it my way this time.
