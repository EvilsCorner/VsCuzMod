:SCENE:1
:GF:l:Pleased:I had a fun time tonight, I think you picked a great place to eat.
:BF:r:Default:Yeah, the food was awesome. I was hoping we could maybe go and see a movie or somethin' afterwards, but we ended up staying at the restaurant a bit longer than I expected. 
:GF:l:Default:Yeah, it's getting pretty late. Do you wanna just head back to my place?
:BF:r:Default:Sounds like a good idea.
:BF:r:Embarrassed:I don't wanna make your dad angry...again...
:GF:l:Flirty:Well, it's funny you mention that because...my parents actually won't be home tonight...
:BF:r:Excited:Oh, that's lucky! We don't have to hurry then!
:BF:r:Excited:We could probably take a shortcut and get there in time for that one movie you've been wantin' to see. Thing's been replaying every hour and a half, yeah?  
:GF:l:Troubled:Boyfriend.
:BF:r:Default:Eh?
:GF:l:Annoyed:...
:GF:l:Annoyed:My parents won't be HOME tonight...
:BF:r:Default:Yeah?
:GF:l:Flirty:I was hoping we could...?
:BF:r:Surprised:Oh...?
:BF:r:Surprised:...
:BF:r:Shocked:OOOOHHHH!
:GF:l:Flirty:Mmhmm~...
:BF:r:Cheeky:Damn, that's, like, a way better plan. Let's hurry back and-

:GF:l:Shocked:...
:BF:r:Shocked:...
:Cuz:l:Default:You gotta be kidding me- 
:SCENE:4
:Cuz:l:Ticked Off:Finally found you after all this time and I miss...Christ...
:Cuz:l:Smug:Ah well... Doesn't matter.
:SCENE:5
:Cuz:l:Smug:It's not like you can leave now that I know you're here. I haven't seen you in months, Girlfriend. 
:Cuz:l:Laugh:Have you been hiding or something?  
:GF:l:Dismissive:Ugh...You really think I'd waste my time doing that? You just suck at your job.
:Cuz:l:Ticked Off:Okay, that's bull-
:GF:l:Annoyed:Listen, can you move or what? I don't have time for this tonight, I'm trying to get home.
:Cuz:l:Enraged:Yeah, like hell you are-
:SCENE:6
:BF:r:Shocked:Wait, wait, wait-!
:SCENE:7
:Cuz:l:Shocked:Wh-...Boyfriend? What the hell are you doing here?
:GF:l:Surprised:Hold on, you know him? 
:Cuz:l:Default:...
:Cuz:l:Ticked Off:...Oh my god, you're joking. You LITERALLY knew I was hunting her, you idiot!
:GF:l:Surprised:What.
:BF:r:Embarrassed:I thought it'd sort itself out!
:GF:l:Troubled:Hold on, hold on...what the hell is going on here?
:BF:r:Embarrassed:Uh, yeah, so...like, don't be mad though, but...Cuz might be my cousin?
:GF:l:Annoyed:...
:GF:l:Dismissive:... (Vine Boom mixed with Studio Laughter Plays)
:BF:r:Nervous:O-okay, they're my cousin!"
:BF:r:Embarrassed:I knew they were hunting you, but I didn't wanna say anything at first cause I thought it might cause problems. And then, y'know, I kinda just...like...forgot after a while? Eheh…
:BF:r:Embarrassed:But hey! Long time no see Cuz! How you been?
:Cuz:l:Default:I legit hate you so much.
:SCENE:8
:Cuz:l:Ticked Off:...Well, what the hell am I supposed to do now, Boyfriend? I'm not leaving ‘til one of us is dead, and it's not gonna be me. I don't care that you two are together or whatever-... 
:BF:r:Nervous:Wait, wait! Okay, uh….how about we, like, rap battle or something? If I win, you gotta leave us alone, and if you win, :GF has to fight you?
:GF:l:Annoyed:You're joking-...
:Cuz:l:Angry:I'm not rap battling you! God, you're, like, the ONLY person in the family who solves problems that way! I'm taking my damn prize! 
:BF:r:Worried With Fist:Oh, c'mon, man! This is the only way I know how to deal with things! Cut me some slack!
:Cuz:l:Pout:...
:Cuz:l:Default:...Ugh...fine. But just because you're family doesn't mean I'll go easy on you. You better be confident in your skills. 
:BF:r:Embarrassed:Eheh...
